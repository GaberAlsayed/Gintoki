Across the series, more details about Gintoki's past are revealed leading him to encounter former friends as enemies. As the main character, Gintoki has appeared in most of the episodes of the anime series, as well as in other media related to the franchise, including the film and all of the spin-off video games and original

<p>Sorachi created the character after suggestions of his editors of having silver-haired samurai. He was originally going to be based on Hijikata Toshizō, the vice-captain from the Shinsengumi special forces.

In the anime series Gintoki was voiced by Tomokazu Sugita who enjoyed his character. For the English release of the first movie, he was voiced by Christopher Patton, whereas in the latest episodes he Patton was replaced by Michael Daingerfield. Shun Oguri will portray him in the upcoming live-action film.
